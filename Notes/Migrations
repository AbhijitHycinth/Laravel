  MIGRATIONS
=================
MIGRATIONS are seen under database/migrations

By default: Every Migration uses the :  Migration and Blueprint service providers.

  i.e use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
      use Illuminta\Database\Migratins\Migration;

      the "CreatePostsTable"class extends Migrations for its properties

The "CreatePostsTable" class has two functions: ->up()
                                                      ->It is used to create the table in Database with the columns
                                                      By default it takes (id) and date_created and date_updated columns.
                                                      timestamp() creates the date_created and date_updated columns and laravel maintains it.

                                                      NOTE: datetimestamp store both date and time hence the column type will "datetime" for date_created and date_updated;
                                                            for only "date" type, we can use, datestamp
                                                            for only "time" type, we can use , timestamp

                                                            Types of columns: int
                                                                              string (upto 255 chars)
                                                                              text (for more than 255 chars)

                                                                              NOTE: text can store only plain texts and not rich texts like bold characters and everything.
                                                                                    hence we use, html tags to define the format

                                                  eg:public function up()
                                                  {
                                                  Schema :: create('<tablename>'Blueprint $table)   //here $table is a model
                                                                  {
                                                                  $table->increment('id');
                                                                  $table->string('title')->nullable();    //here nullable is a column modifier.
                                                                  $table->timestamps();
                                                                  }
                                                  }
                                                ->down()
                                                        ->The down() function is used to drop the table.
