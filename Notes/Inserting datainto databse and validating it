To insert the data into database we would need a 'post' request in the controller.

NOTE: A post request canbe identified if a (Reques $request) parameter is passed to the function in the controller.
      In a resource controller, thename of the function is create.

eg:
public function store(Request $request)
{
  //validate the data
  //Store in the database
  //redirectto another page
}

+========================
        VALIDATE
============================
NOTE: Validation can be done in CONTROLLERS since laravel's validation is part of the Controller class.
      Validation needs 2 parameters:
                                      ->Request: the data to be validated .
                                      ->array(): This is the array of rules.
                                              ->The validation rules canbe found : https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/validation
                                              ->it takes the NAME of the field we are validating

                                    eg:
                                    public function store(Request $request)
                                    {
                                    $this->validate($request,array(
                                      'title'=>'required|max::255',
                                      'body'=>'required'
                                    ))
                                    }

                                    multiple validation rules can be inserted using '|' as de limiter.
                                    in th above case you can see required|max::255 are multiple validation rules.


NOTE: The above validations are server side validations.This means that the validation takes place only after the user has clicked the submit button,
      and then the server validates it.Laravel includes CSRF (Cross Server Request Forging) protection, which prevents bots to hack.
      However, it is much prettier to have javascript validations, but javascript validations are hackable. Hence alongwith javascript validations,
      it is a must to have the server side validations as well.


==============================
        INSERTION
==============================
For inserting or interacting with the databse with the considered model, we use LARAVEL ELOQUENT.
ELOQUENT is a way of interacting with the database without the requirement of the MySQl commands.

No wo insert, wewill create an INSTANCE of the MODEL of the DATABASE in which the data needs to be isnerted.
This is done as follows:
                        $post = new Post;
                        $post -> title = $request -> title;
                        $post -> body= $request -> body;

                        $post -> save(); // is used to save data in databse.
                        // When save() command is used it , generates the 'id' and 'timestamps'
We use the 'id' created to redirect to the new page.

Remember to: use App\Post;
            // This is to use themodel.

            NOTE: namespae App\Controller;
                  here namespace is equilvalent to packages in JAva;

                  similarly 'use' : is equivalent to 'import' in java.

==============================
        REDIRECT
==============================

                      return redirect() -> route('posts.show', $post->id);

                      NOTE: here 'posts.show' is the routeof the new page.
                            Cannot pass post-> id before saving the model.

posts.show($id) is used toredirect to the new page.

  JAVA SCRIPT FORM Validation
===============================

->We are going to use Parsley Javascript form validation.
