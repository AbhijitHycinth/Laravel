Models are used to talk to the database.
NAMING CONVENTION:
                  -> Models are SINGULAR version with a first letter capital of the table in the database
                    i.e suppose, table_name = posts  (plural)
                                 model_name = Post  (SINGULAR with first CAPITAL)

NOTE: php artisan <artisan command>
      Means that "artisan" commands to be interpreted using php
    ->Where <artisan command> can be "serve"

We use the "php artisan make " command to make things like views, models, controllers quickly

DON'T USE THIS->php artisan make:model Posts    //here Posts is the name of the model to be created.

Migrations are used to create and edit DATABASE Tables through laravel.
It can be used to partners to take our tables.

USE THIS-> php artisan make:model Post --migration
           or
           php artisan make:model Post -m

          The above creates a model Post and migrations posts.
