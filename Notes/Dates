Dates in MySQL are stored as a string. However, PHP works with dates as a UNIX
Timestamp. This is an integer of the number of seconds that have passed since
Jan 1, 1970 UTC. Before we can do anything with dates, we need to first convert
our database time string into something that PHP will work with.

To get a UNIX timestamp from a string you need to use strtotime() function from
PHP. This converts it into an Integer unix timestamp.

Then to get the timestamp into a user friendly view, we need to use the PHP
Date() command. This command will accepts a string formula as its first argument
and a unix timestamp as its second argument. You can create the formula you want
by looking on the PHP Date() website. I have the link below.

Next we work with Html::linkRoute() which allows us to give it a named route and
it creates an html anchor tag (aka link). The first argument is the named route
(string), the second is the value of the anchor tag, the third is an array
(empty if no url params, or add the params in order), and the final argument is
another array of all the options you want to use.
